## Process Flow

1. Visitor arrives at church and is welcomed by a member of the greeting team.
2. Visitor is directed to the visitor management webpage on a tablet or other device.
3. Visitor inputs their personal information (name, email, phone, mailing address) and answers a few questions about their journey to Christ.
4. Visitor submits the form, which stores their information in the database.
5. A member of the church's communication team receives a notification that a new visitor has registered.
6. The communication team member sends a personalized follow-up message or letter to the visitor, thanking them for their visit and offering further resources or information about the church.
